1. PROJECT TITLE

The name of my project is called "CLICKED TO HUNDRED"

2. PROJECTION DESCRIPTION

My game is a two player game. In my game, player one and player two will have to race
to see who will reach to one hundred points. I have built a interaction system for my
players to reach one hundred points. Player one will use the "ENTER key" on the keyboard
and player two will use the "SPACE key" on the keyboard to reach to one hundred points.
If player one reach to one hundred points, player one will receive a alert notification that will say
"PLAYER ONE IS THE WINNER! PRESS THE 'RESTART HERE!' TO PLAY AGAIN!". If player two reach to one hundred point,
player two will receive a alert notification that will say "PLAYER TWO IS THE WINNER! PRESS THE 'RESTART HERE!' TO PLAY AGAIN!".
If player one and player two do not reach to one hundred before the time runs out, both of the player will lose against the timer
and will have to restart the game for the individual to actually win the game. When the time runs out, you will get a alert notifcation
saying "TRY AGAIN, YOU BOTH DID NOT BEAT THE TIME!". In a game, I beleive a restart button is a important function for gamers because
it helps players exercise to understand how to play the game all over again or maybe the players feel like they are being cheated, with that
happening the restart button will help the players for redemption.
